treewatch
=========

treewatch is a simple program to watch a directory and execute a program when
there is a change in the files within the directory.

As currently configured it watches for changes in .c, .h and .cpp files and
runs /usr/bin/make.

treewatch requires inotify support so will only work on Linux.

See TODO for future plans.

See http://atchoo.org/tools/treewatch/ for updates.
