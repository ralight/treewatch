treewatch 1.0 (20080224)
========================

treewatch is a simple program to watch a set of directories and execute a
program when there is a change in the files within the directories.

If run with no options it will watch the current directory for changes in .c,
.cpp and .h files and execute /usr/bin/make on changes.

Example:

treewatch -c /bin/echo -o "hello world" -f .txt

This example will run /bin/echo with the options "hello world" when files with
ending .txt are modified in the current directory. Run with -h to see more
options.

treewatch requires inotify support so will only work on Linux.

See TODO for possible future plans.

See http://atchoo.org/tools/treewatch/ for updates or contact roger@atchoo.org
