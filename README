treewatch
=========

treewatch is a simple program to watch a set of directories and execute a
program when there is a change in the files within the directories.

If run with no options it will watch the current directory for changes in .c,
.cpp and .h files and execute /usr/bin/make on changes.

Run with -h to see options.

treewatch requires inotify support so will only work on Linux.

See TODO for future plans.

See http://atchoo.org/tools/treewatch/ for updates.
