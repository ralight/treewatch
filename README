treewatch
=========

treewatch is a simple program to watch a set of directories and execute a
program when there is a change in the files within the directories.

As currently configured it watches for changes in .c, .h and .cpp files.

If run with no options it will watch the current directory for changes and
execute /usr/bin/make on changes.

Run with -h to see options.

treewatch requires inotify support so will only work on Linux.

See TODO for future plans.

See http://atchoo.org/tools/treewatch/ for updates.
